**Variables**

- in any programming language variables are containers that store values and they behave like the values they store.They can store numbers, decimals, characters, strings, boolean

**sample programme**

first_name="Jafar"

print(f"Hello, my name is {first_name}")

**Data types in python**

1.Strings-A series of characters e.g"fake123@gmail.com", they should be enclosed in double quotes or single quotes

2.Float-This are decimal Numbers distance=12.5

3.Boolean value-A boolean value can either be true or false , most of the times boolean values are not outputted directly, they are used in if statements or other control structures

4.integers-This are whole Numbers 

**Note**-in every programming language each variable should have a unique variable name
